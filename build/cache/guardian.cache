<title>Wednesday briefing: What Ofgem’s prepayment meter restrictions really mean</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/19/wednesday-briefing-what-ofgems-prepayment-meter-restrictions-really-mean</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: The ban on energy firms forcibly installing meters in some homes has been called ‘woefully insufficient’ – here’s what it all means in practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy companies have been the focus of criticism after stories about firms forcibly installing prepayment meters in the homes of vulnerable customers came to light. They say they have no choice; that this practice is a last resort aimed at customers who are not engaging with them and racking up unsustainable debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US news | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Fox is to pay the voting technology firm Dominion &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/18/fox-dominion-settle-us-defamation-lawsuit"&gt;US$787.5m in a settlement&lt;/a&gt; to avoid a high-profile defamation trial. The deal was announced just before opening statements were due to be delivered in the Delaware supreme court and has ended the dispute over whether Fox News and its parent company knowingly broadcast false allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politics | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Rishi Sunak is under investigation by the parliamentary watchdog over a potential failure to declare &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/18/rishi-sunak-wife-stake-childcare-firm-not-mentioned-six-ministerial-registers"&gt;his wife’s stake in a childcare company in six ministerial registers.&lt;/a&gt; If the inquiry finds that he has breached the code of conduct for MPs, Sunak could be ordered to apologise to the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has had his appeal rejected and will be held in detention before his trial in May on charges of espionage. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/russian-judge-rejects-wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovichs-detention-appeal"&gt;Gershkovich is the first US journalist&lt;/a&gt; to be detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the cold war and, if found guilty, could face up to 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign policy | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;James Cleverly has told the Guardian that Britain should not &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/18/uk-should-not-pull-the-shutters-down-on-china-says-james-cleverly"&gt;“pull the shutters down” on China&lt;/a&gt; as it would be damaging to the national interest, arguing that the UK’s approach needs to be more nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Research has found that up to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/18/up-to-one-20-new-diabetes-cases-could-linked-covid-study"&gt;one in 20 new diabetes cases &lt;/a&gt;could be related to Covid infection. While lifestyle factors like being overweight or obese continue to be the main driver for the increase, this data is the latest evidence that the pandemic may be contributing to a rapidly escalating diabetes crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/19/wednesday-briefing-what-ofgems-prepayment-meter-restrictions-really-mean"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tuesday briefing: Sudan has been thrown into bitter violence, thanks to two generals turned rivals</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/first-edition-sudan</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: Just four years after the country celebrated a military coup, the two leaders who assumed power have fallen out – and brought unrest to Khartoum and beyond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudan has found itself in the midst of another crisis, as fighting erupted in the capital, Khartoum, over the weekend between rival military groups after months of growing disquiet over the future of the country and its democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; MPs in the women and equalities committee have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/18/mps-condemn-failure-to-tackle-glaring-racial-inequalities-in-uk-maternal-health"&gt;accused ministers of failing to tackle&lt;/a&gt; “appalling” and “glaring” racial disparities in maternal health despite repeated promises. They have called for new targets to eliminate inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; A serving police sergeant in Plymouth &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/police-officer-david-stansbury-charged-with-raping-woman-while-on-duty-plymouth"&gt;faces three rape charges&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly raping a woman while he was on duty more than a decade ago. The alleged offences took place in 2009 and were reported to the police in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Air France and Airbus &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/air-france-and-airbus-cleared-of-involuntary-manslaughter-over-2009-crash"&gt;have been cleared of involuntary manslaughter&lt;/a&gt; over a 2009 crash that killed 228 people. The court ruled “no certain causal link” with the accident could be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Slovakia has joined Poland and Hungary in their decision&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/slovakia-joins-poland-hungary-halting-ukraine-grain-imports"&gt; to stop imports of grain and other food products from Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to protect local farmers. The European Commission and Kyiv have criticised these bans and have asked the country’s involved to offer an explanation for their decision, following reports that Bulgaria is considering following suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The price of basic staple foods like&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/18/cost-of-british-food-basics-increases-by-up-to-80-in-a-year"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/18/cost-of-british-food-basics-increases-by-up-to-80-in-a-year"&gt;cheddar cheese, white bread and pork sausages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;has increased by up to 80% in some shops over the past year, in further evidence that inflation could be hitting poorer households hardest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/first-edition-sudan"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Monday briefing: Fox News, Tucker Carlson and the $1.6bn trial over ‘rigged election’ misinformation</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/first-edition-dominion-lawsuit-fox</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: The American media giant face technology firm Dominion in court over claims their machines aided in rigging the 2020 election – here’s what you need to know about the trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most high-profile defamation trials in American history is due to begin this week. Dominion Voting Systems, an election technology firm, is taking Fox Corporation and its TV network to court for $1.6bn, alleging that the media conglomerate pushed false claims that Dominion’s voting machines were rigged in the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental health |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Research has found that a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/16/buckling-nhs-fails-to-treat-250000-children-with-mental-health-problems"&gt;quarter of a million children with mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; have been denied access to relevant services, as the NHS struggles to cope with surging referrals and case loads. In some parts of the country spending per child is four times higher than in others and average waits for a first appointment vary by trust from 10 days to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudan |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; At least 97 people have been killed and hundreds wounded as violent clashes spread across Sudan &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/sudan-death-toll-nears-100-as-fighting-rages-and-hospitals-run-short-of-supplies"&gt;between the country’s military and main paramilitary force&lt;/a&gt;. The UN World Food Programme has said it is temporarily halting all operations in Sudan after the deaths of three employees in the Darfur region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labour |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/16/labour-glitch-put-voting-intentions-data-of-millions-at-risk"&gt;glitch in the party’s main phone banking system&lt;/a&gt; has left the voting intentions of millions of people across the country at risk of misuse. A Labour party spokesperson said: “As soon as this question was brought to our attention, the system was taken down for investigation. The party takes the security of all personal information for which it is responsible extremely seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A Guardian investigation has found that sexual misconduct and racism claims against police officers are&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/police-forces-sexual-misconduct-racism-claims-higher-than-met"&gt; proportionally higher in some English forces than at the Metropolitan police&lt;/a&gt;. The report also revealed the stark differences in the way different forces record complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Leaked classified documents from US intelligence services suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/16/china-rapidly-achieve-air-superiority-taiwan-us-leaks"&gt;China would probably be able to establish air superiority swiftly&lt;/a&gt; in any attack on Taiwan, with Pentagon analysis concluding that China’s air force would find it far easier than Russia has in its invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/first-edition-dominion-lawsuit-fox"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Friday briefing: Has a ‘woke aristocracy’ really taken control of British society?</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/first-edition-new-elite-matthew-goodwin</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: Interrogating academic Matthew Goodwin’s description of a new left-wing elite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. There’s a new lefty elite running Britain, and they hate you because they think you’re a racist. That is &lt;a href="https://mattgoodwin.substack.com/p/rise-of-the-new-elite"&gt;the central contention&lt;/a&gt; advanced by the scholar of populist politics Matthew Goodwin, and if the idea was already looming in the Overton window before his attention-hoovering new book came out, it is now hauling itself onto the balcony and clambering through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the former government equality tsar Trevor Phillips &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/loudmouth-minorities-are-ruling-the-roost-glsl0x968"&gt;wrote that&lt;/a&gt; “the political and media elite” have achieved “institutional capture” across swathes of the UK’s governing apparatus. The Spectator magazine &lt;a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-new-elite-the-rise-of-the-progressive-aristocracy/"&gt;devoted its cover&lt;/a&gt; to the “new elite” and how “the woke aristocracy” is on a “march through the institutions”. And Liz Truss, who was quite recently the prime minister, claimed that her monumental unpopularity was not the result of incompetence, but &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/12/liz-truss-speech-sketch-heritage-foundation"&gt;of an elite “coordinated resistance”&lt;/a&gt; that “reached into the media and the broader establishment”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pentagon leaks &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The FBI has arrested Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old air national guardsman in Massachusetts, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/13/pentagon-leaked-documents-suspect-arrested"&gt;on suspicion of being responsible for the leak of US classified defence documents&lt;/a&gt; that laid bare military secrets and upset Washington’s relations with key allies. You can find a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/13/who-is-jack-teixeira-the-man-arrested-over-pentagon-files-leak"&gt;profile of Teixeira here&lt;/a&gt;, and read &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/14/jack-teixeria-arrested-what-we-know-so-far-about-pentagon-leak-suspect"&gt;what we know so far&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | More senior Conservatives &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/senior-conservatives-hit-out-at-suella-bravermans-racist-rhetoric"&gt;have hit out at Suella Braverman’s “racist rhetoric”&lt;/a&gt;, accusing her of undermining the party for the sake of her own leadership ambitions. A former senior minister from Boris Johnson’s government told the Guardian they believed Braverman was a “real racist bigot”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nursing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Nurses in England will go back on strike this month &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/14/new-nurses-strikes-likely-in-england-if-rcn-members-reject-pay-offer"&gt;if RCN members reject ministers’ latest pay offer&lt;/a&gt;, with officials saying the result of the three-week ballot is too close to call. The Royal College of Nursing will announce the results of its vote on Friday after a lengthy consultation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Eight serving and former Metropolitan police officers &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/13/eight-met-officers-guilty-of-misconduct-over-discriminatory-whatsapp-messages"&gt;have been found guilty of gross misconduct&lt;/a&gt; after they were found to have sent sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic and ableist comments in a Whatsapp group between 2016 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fashion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Mary Quant, the British designer who made the miniskirt fashionable, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/13/fashion-designer-dame-mary-quant-dies"&gt;has died aged 93&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement, her family said she “was one of the most internationally recognised fashion designers of the 20th century and an outstanding innovator of the Swinging Sixties”. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/13/equal-parts-practical-and-daring-how-mary-quant-created-look-for-a-new-way-of-living"&gt;Read Jess Cartner-Morley’s tribute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/first-edition-new-elite-matthew-goodwin"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Thursday briefing: What serious new leaks from the Pentagon have to say about Ukraine, Russia and more</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: A cache of classified US government documents expose the country’s thinking on the Ukraine conflict and much more &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. To a list that most famously includes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/28/wikileaks-julian-assange-alan-rusbridger"&gt;the WikiLeaks revelations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files"&gt;the NSA files unearthed by Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt;, a major new leak of classified US government information must now be added. And while &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/11/pentagon-leaks-us-seeks-to-mend-ties-after-claims-washington-spied-on-key-allies"&gt;the Pentagon documents&lt;/a&gt; now in circulation are far fewer in number, they have appeared with remarkable speed – and relate to perhaps the most sensitive arena of intelligence gathering in the world today: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of how they emerged is astonishing – and this morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/13/pentagon-leaks-og-source-military-base-discord-report"&gt;Julian Borger writes&lt;/a&gt; that the culprit is reported to be a young, racist gun enthusiast who worked on a military base. As the US battles to control the fallout from the leak with its allies, today’s newsletter takes you through what we know. Here are the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Ireland &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Joe Biden has promised to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/12/joe-biden-us-investment-northern-ireland-power-sharing"&gt;boost US investment into Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; if power sharing is restored. In a thinly veiled message to the Democratic Unionist party, the US president told an audience in Belfast that American investors were ready to “triple” the $2bn already invested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | The UK is experiencing a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/13/uk-in-rapidly-escalating-diabetes-crisis-as-cases-top-5m-report-says"&gt;“rapidly escalating” diabetes crisis&lt;/a&gt;, with cases topping five million for the first time and under-40s increasingly affected, a report has revealed. About 90% of UK diabetes patients have type 2, a condition much more likely to develop if people are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK politics &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A senior Conservative peer &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/12/tory-peer-warsi-accuses-suella-braverman-racist-rhetoric-grooming-gangs"&gt;has accused Suella Braverman of using “racist rhetoric”&lt;/a&gt; after the home secretary singled out British-Pakistani men as being of special concern in relation to child sexual abuse cases. Lady Warsi said Conservatives cannot “use the pigment in their skin as a defence mechanism to say they are not racist”. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/suella-braverman-diversity-cabinet-british-pakistani-men-rishi-sunak"&gt;Read her comment piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotland &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Scottish ministers &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/12/scotland-launch-legal-challenge-uk-government-block-gender-reform-bill"&gt;will challenge the UK government’s block on Holyrood’s gender recognition reform bill&lt;/a&gt;, putting new first minster Humza Yousaf on a constitutional collision course with Westminster. The SNP said the move was necessary to achieve legal clarity on whether the issue was a devolved matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wildlife &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A couple in Pembrokeshire whose trees disappeared from their garden “overnight” have unmasked the unlikely culprit: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/12/first-wild-beaver-in-wales-in-400-years-caught-felling-trees-in-garden"&gt;the first wild beaver spotted in Wales in years&lt;/a&gt;. A hidden camera deployed after the trees were damaged revealed “a beaver swimming around our pond and eating our trees,” the couple said. “We couldn’t believe it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/first-edition-pentagon-leaks"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Wednesday briefing: Why Joe Biden’s visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland matters</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/12/first-edition-joe-biden-ireland</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: The ‘most Irish president since JFK’ embarks on a visit to mark 25 years of the Good Friday Agreement – and to influence the region’s politics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Last night, Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/11/joe-biden-to-meet-british-pm-and-taoiseach-on-island-of-ireland-visit"&gt;was greeted in Belfast by Rishi Sunak&lt;/a&gt;; today, he will deliver a keynote address at Ulster University’s campus to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement before heading to the Republic of Ireland. And while “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/world/europe/biden-ireland-visit.html"&gt;the most Irish president since JFK&lt;/a&gt;” will stop &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/09/biden-ireland-visit-good-friday-agreement"&gt;to pay respects to his ancestors&lt;/a&gt; and meet relatives in County Mayo and County Louth after he goes to Dublin, this trip is about more than heritage tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the devolved Northern Ireland assembly still not functioning and the shape of the cross-border relationship changing because of Sunak’s post-Brexit deal, Biden said that his priorities for the trip were to “make sure the Irish accords and Windsor agreements stay in place. Keep the peace and that’s the main thing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBI &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Police &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/11/city-of-london-police-open-inquiry-into-alleged-sexual-misconduct-at-cbi"&gt;have launched an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct at the Confederation of British Industry&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the Guardian’s reports of complaints against senior figures at the organisation. In a day of turmoil, the CBI announced it had dismissed its director general, Tony Danker, who had been suspended following separate allegations over his conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| US intelligence reportedly warned in February that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/us-ukraine-counter-offensive-pentagon-leaks-reveal"&gt;Ukraine might fail to amass sufficient troops and weaponry&lt;/a&gt; for its planned spring counter-offensive, according to one of a trove of leaked defence documents. The leak also indicated that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/11/up-to-50-uk-special-forces-present-in-ukraine-this-year-us-leak-suggests"&gt;the UK has deployed as many as 50 special forces&lt;/a&gt; to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Ireland &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The man &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/11/freddie-scappaticci-suspected-of-being-stakeknife-spy-in-ira-dies"&gt;said to be the British army’s most important agent inside the Provisional IRA has died&lt;/a&gt;, putting a question mark over the inquiry into his alleged crimes and the role played by security forces. Freddie Scappaticci, who was alleged to have been a top mole known as Stakeknife, was in his early 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The landlady of a pub whose collection of golliwog dolls was confiscated by police has assembled replacements, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/essex-pub-landlady-benice-ryley-replaces-golliwog-doll-collection-that-was-seized-by-police"&gt;she plans to display in defiance of a continuing investigation&lt;/a&gt;. Benice Ryley, who denies any racist intent, confirmed that her husband had been photographed in a T-shirt from the far-right group Britain First.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Twitter owner Elon Musk has said the social media site &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/12/elon-musk-says-bbcs-twitter-tag-will-be-changed-from-government-funded-media"&gt;will update the BBC’s “government-funded media” tag&lt;/a&gt; after the broadcaster objected to the label. In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, Musk said he had the “utmost respect” for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/12/first-edition-joe-biden-ireland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tuesday briefing: Is there really a crisis in theatre audience behaviour – or is this all overdramatic?</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/first-edition-theatre-audience-behaviour</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: With reported attacks on ushers and police called to handle overzealous audience participation, some argue the sanctity of the stage is under threat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. The next time you go to a play, you may find that the most shocking scenes are taking place off stage. That, at least, is the pattern in a spate of recent dramas in the stalls across Britain: from stories about &lt;a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-production-jersey-boys-halted-26104772"&gt;an usher being punched&lt;/a&gt; after asking rowdy audience members to tone it down in Edinburgh to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/heckler-gets-life-ban-from-royal-opera-house-for-shouting-rubbish-at-child-actor"&gt;a heckler barracking a child actor&lt;/a&gt; at the Royal Opera House and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/24/london-theatres-lock-up-audiences-phones-illicit-james-norton-photos"&gt;illicit nude photos&lt;/a&gt; being taken of James Norton in the West End, there are multiplying worries that the traditional hush of the theatre is under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Good Friday, a performance of the Bodyguard in Manchester &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/08/bodyguard-performance-stops-early-as-disruptive-audience-members-are-removed"&gt;was stopped and police were called&lt;/a&gt; to deal with two audience members who insisted on tunelessly singing along to I Will Always Love You while everyone else tried to listen. One measure of the strength of feeling: the furious reception for TV presenter Alison Hammond’s prior suggestion that she would be skipping the show as a result of the theatre’s approach to audience participation, and &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/alison-hammond-the-bodyguard-singing-audience-b2317045.html"&gt;her subsequent grovelling apology&lt;/a&gt;. The stage is meant to arouse our passions, but not, surely, like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Junior doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/10/junior-doctors-may-keep-striking-for-another-year-says-bma-insider"&gt;may keep striking for another year&lt;/a&gt; in their bitter pay dispute with the government, despite NHS leaders’ growing alarm about how the industrial action is disrupting patient care. Sources at the BMA, the main doctors’ union, warned of the possible escalation as hospitals prepare for a four day strike beginning on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Benjamin Netanyahu &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/netanyahu-reverses-decision-to-fire-israel-defence-minister-after-mass-protests"&gt;has reversed his decision to fire the defence minister, Yoav Gallant,&lt;/a&gt; for warning that his judicial overhaul was harming the military. After an unprecedented surge in protests over the decision, Netanyahu announced on Monday night that Gallant would stay in his post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Ireland &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A crowd &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/10/derry-security-operation-under-way-before-dissident-republican-parade"&gt;has attacked police with petrol bombs and other missiles&lt;/a&gt; during a parade by dissident republicans in Derry on the eve of Joe Biden’s visit to Northern Ireland. About a dozen people in camouflage gear marched through the neighbourhood to commemorate the 1916 Rising with the backing of Saoradh, the political wing of the New IRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US national security &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The US is attempting to mend fences with key allies, after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/11/pentagon-leaks-us-seeks-to-mend-ties-after-claims-washington-spied-on-key-allies"&gt;claims in leaked Pentagon documents of spying on friendly nations&lt;/a&gt;, including South Korea and Israel. The leak represents Washington’s worst national security breach in years and included details about Ukraine’s lack of ammunition and US intelligence collection methods used against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The Dalai Lama &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/dalai-lama-apologises-kissing-boy-suck-his-tongue-video"&gt;has apologised after he faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour&lt;/a&gt; when he kissed a young boy on the lips and asking him to “suck his tongue” at a public event in India. The office of the Dalai Lama said his behaviour had been “innocent and playful”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/first-edition-theatre-audience-behaviour"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Monday briefing: Is there a solution to Britain’s bank holiday traffic nightmare?</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/monday-briefing-easter-bank-holiday-traffic</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: The whole country knows it’s coming, but getaway gridlock still wracks the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning, and if you have spent the weekend drowning in chocolate or stuck in traffic, solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a weekend with more than &lt;a href="https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/news/motoring-news/good-friday-could-turn-bad-on-the-roads-as-up-to-17m-easter-trips-by-car/"&gt;17m leisure trips expected on British roads&lt;/a&gt;; delayed or cancelled trains causing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RooPritchard/status/1644303267541798913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1644303267541798913%7Ctwgr%5Ecf539c84bcd777ce5f941ddd94393240d5cf2894%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windsorobserver.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fnational%2F23442840.london-station-like-last-train-saigon-amid-easter-travel-disruption%2F"&gt;vast crowds&lt;/a&gt; for those persevering with the railways; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/06/queues-dover-port-easter-weekend-travel-delays"&gt;getaway-ruining gridlock continuing&lt;/a&gt; around the Port of Dover, today’s newsletter – with &lt;a href="http://drivingchange.org.uk/"&gt;Professor David Metz&lt;/a&gt;, former chief scientist at the Department of Transport – looks at our perennial anxiety about bank holiday transport chaos, how bad it is, and what there is to be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racism &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| More than a third of people from minority groups have experienced racially motivated physical or verbal abuse, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/09/britain-not-close-to-being-a-racially-just-society-finds-two-year-research-project"&gt;according to the biggest survey of race inequality in the UK for over a quarter of a century&lt;/a&gt;. The survey found “strikingly high” levels of exposure to abuse across a wide range of ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | The Good Friday agreement was “based on compromise”, Rishi Sunak has said on the peace deal’s 25th anniversary. Sunak called on Northern Ireland’s politicians to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/10/good-friday-agreement-anniversary-northern-ireland-rishi-sunak"&gt;restore the power sharing agreement at Stormont&lt;/a&gt; as preparations continue for a visit by Joe Biden this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monarchy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A green energy company set up by King Charles &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/09/king-charles-jv-energen-green-firm-38-day-gas-leak"&gt;was investigated for numerous health and safety breaches&lt;/a&gt; after the unauthorised leak of more than 1,000 tonnes of global heating gases. The Health and Safety Executive issued a series of improvement notices after the 2020 leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | China &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/09/taiwan-monitors-for-missiles-as-china-begins-second-day-of-military-drills"&gt;sent dozens of warplanes towards Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; for a second day of military drills in retaliation for the island’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, meeting the US House Speaker during a brief visit to the US. About 70 aircraft including fighter jets, reconnaissance planes, and refuellers went into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labour &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Keir Starmer &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/09/keri-starmer-defends-insensitive-labour-advert-on-child-sexual-assaults"&gt;has defended a widely-criticised attack ad&lt;/a&gt; which said that Rishi Sunak “does not believe adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison”. In an article for the Daily Mail, Starmer said that he stands by “every word Labour has said on this subject”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/monday-briefing-easter-bank-holiday-traffic"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Friday briefing: Britain’s rivers and oceans are filling with sewage – with no sign of stopping</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/07/friday-briefing-britains-rivers-and-oceans-are-filling-with-sewage-with-no-sign-of-stopping</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: The government and private water companies have failed for years to get a grip on unfiltered sewage in our waterways – why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Many people, perhaps including you, are gearing up for a long bank holiday weekend somewhere picturesque – maybe at a seaside town or by a nice river in the countryside. The normal stresses of going away aside, there is one other thing that everyone should be looking out for if they plan on going swimming or even paddling in the water: poo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government and water companies &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/therese-coffey-accused-of-throwing-in-the-towel-over-sewage-scandal"&gt;have faced mounting pressure&lt;/a&gt; over the volume of untreated sewage being dumped daily into Britain’s rivers and oceans. The media and the public alike have been causing a stink about the waste that has been thrown into the country’s waterways, seemingly with impunity, for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle East&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Israeli jets &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/06/israel-launches-airstrikes-in-gaza-strip-after-biggest-rocket-salvo-since-2006-war"&gt;hit sites in Lebanon and Gaza&lt;/a&gt; early on Friday, in retaliation for rocket attacks it blamed on the Islamist group Hamas, as tensions following police raids on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem this week threatened to spiral out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Stormy Daniels has sat down &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/06/stormy-daniels-interview-donald-trump-indictment"&gt;with Piers Morgan in her first major&lt;/a&gt; interview since Donald Trump’s indictment and said that while she believes Donald Trump should be held accountable, she doesn’t think his crimes against her “are worthy of incarceration”. She added however that if he is found guilty of his other charges he should go to prison. “The king has been dethroned – he’s no longer untouchable,” the 44-year-old said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservatives | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Allies of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/06/rishi-sunak-says-no-further-action-against-mark-spencer-over-nusrat-ghani-sacking"&gt;Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani&lt;/a&gt; have voiced concerns of a cover-up of Islamophobia in the party after minister and former chief whip Mark Spencer was cleared of rule-breaking over allegations that he told Ghani that she was sacked because of her Muslim faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;John McFall, the lord speaker, has said that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/06/house-of-lords-speaker-john-mcfall-boris-johnson-liz-truss-allies"&gt;House of Lords needs more independent, expert peers.&lt;/a&gt; McFall’s comments come as controversy grows over plans by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss to fill the chamber with dozens of political allies and donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronavirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Public health bodies in the UK have announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/06/covid-vaccine-vulnerable-babies-children"&gt;two doses of a Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt; will be offered to vulnerable children and babies between the ages of six months and four years old from mid-June.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/07/friday-briefing-britains-rivers-and-oceans-are-filling-with-sewage-with-no-sign-of-stopping"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Thursday briefing: What the royal family don’t want you to know about their finances</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/06/first-edition-cost-of-the-crown-royal-finances</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: A new Guardian series reveals just how much the royal family get – and why it’s been so hard to find out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Last year, King Charles and his late mother received £41.8m in income from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall – in real terms, about 16 times what the family received in 1952, when the queen came to the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Elizabeth became queen, she and Charles &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2023/apr/05/revealed-royals-took-more-than-1bn-income-from-controversial-estates-king-charles-queen-duchies-cornwall-lancaster"&gt;received more than £1.2bn in income&lt;/a&gt;; the average British worker would have earned about £1.4m over the same period. The Duchy of Cornwall alone is worth more than £1bn, and the duchies pay no corporation tax or capital gains tax on their substantial investment portfolios. Given all of this, you may not be that surprised to learn that the royal family is extremely unenthusiastic to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotland &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Peter Murrell, Nicola Sturgeon’s husband and until last month the SNP’s chief executive, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/05/peter-murrell-nicola-sturgeons-husband-arrested-over-snp-funding-investigation"&gt;has been arrested&lt;/a&gt; by police investigating allegations that £600,000 raised to campaign for independence was instead used for the party’s day-to-day running costs. Murrell was released without charge pending further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The UK government has suspended its relationship with the Confederation of British Industry, as pressure mounts after the Guardian revealed multiple &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/03/revealed-new-claims-of-sexual-misconduct-and-toxic-culture-at-cbi"&gt;allegations of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt; by the lobby group’s staff. Sources said engagement had been “paused” pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations including rape and drug-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | The liberal judge Janet Protasiewicz &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/04/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results"&gt;has won her race for a seat on Wisconsin’s supreme court&lt;/a&gt;, flipping control of the court after a 15-year conservative majority. The race has been called the most important election of the year in the US, with abortion rights, redistricting and election rules at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Conservative MP Scott Benton &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/05/rishi-sunak-facing-calls-suspend-whip-scott-benton"&gt;has had the party whip suspended&lt;/a&gt; after he reportedly offered to lobby ministers on behalf of the gambling industry and leak a confidential policy document for up to £4,000 a month. Benton allegedly offered to “put parliamentary questions on the table” on behalf of reporters for the Times posing as representatives of a fake investment fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Zealand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Jacinda Ardern &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/jacinda-ardern-leaders-can-be-sensitive-kind-farewell-speech-new-zealand"&gt;has left New Zealand’s parliament with a highly personal speech&lt;/a&gt;, calling for an opening up of politics to those who may not see themselves as typical leaders. In her final address to the country, the former PM said: “You can be anxious, sensitive, kind and wear your heart on your sleeve … and not only can you be here – you can lead.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/06/first-edition-cost-of-the-crown-royal-finances"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Wednesday briefing: the Trump prosecutors have audio - and what else we learned in court</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/first-edition-donald-trump-court</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: Donald Trump was arraigned in a Manhattan court yesterday, as he pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Donald Trump arrived with his 11-vehicle motorcade at the Manhattan criminal courthouse in the early afternoon, had his fingerprints taken, was assigned a New York State identification number, and walked into his arraignment behind a court officer who let the door swing shut in his face. Then, around half a century after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/01/trump-investigations-history-timeline/"&gt;he was first accused of breaking the law&lt;/a&gt;, he finally faced charges for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to indictment number 71543-23, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/04/donald-trump-charges-34-felony-counts"&gt;Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records&lt;/a&gt;. He stands accused of covering up hush money payments made to the adult film star Stormy Daniels, and left without speaking to reporters. He is the first former president to face criminal charges in American history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches"&gt;has been fined £12.7m&lt;/a&gt; for multiple breaches of data protection law, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said on Tuesday. The commissioner has said that the company failed to enforce age limits, meaning that up to 1.4 million UK children under 13 are using the platform as of 2020, according to its own data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Thérèse Coffey has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/therese-coffey-accused-of-throwing-in-the-towel-over-sewage-scandal"&gt;admitted she cannot end the rampant pollution of rivers with sewage&lt;/a&gt; as she launched the government’s cleaner water plan. Critics accused the environment secretary of abdicating her responsibilities after she argued that upgrading sewage systems would add hundreds of pounds to bills, adding that those who say they could end the problem are “either detached from reality or being definitively dishonest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Dozens of worshippers were injured &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/israel-al-aqsa-mosque-rocket-sirens-around-gaza"&gt;in clashes at Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque compound&lt;/a&gt; early on Wednesday, in what Israeli police said was a response to rioting. Jordan’s foreign ministry condemned the al-Aqsa clashes, while Egypt called for an immediate halt to Israel’s “blatant assault on worshippers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brexit | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Sweden &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/04/sweden-expelled-1100-british-nationals-since-uk-left-eu"&gt;has expelled nearly 1,100 British citizens&lt;/a&gt; since Brexit, according to data released by the European Commission. The news comes after the “deeply shocking” decision by Sweden’s immigration authorities to order an elderly British woman with Alzheimer’s to leave the country because she did not have relevant post-Brexit residency papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Rupert Murdoch &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/04/rupert-murdoch-calls-off-engagement-ann-lesley-smith"&gt;has abruptly ended his engagement&lt;/a&gt; to the conservative radio host Ann Lesley Smith. The 92-year-old was due to get married to Smith, 66, less than a year after he finalised his divorce from Jerry Hall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/first-edition-donald-trump-court"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tuesday briefing: Sanna Marin forced out as prime minister after elections see Finland turn right</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/04/first-edition-sanna-marin-finland-election</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: By all means a popular prime minister, Marin has quit ahead of a likely right-wing coalition government capitalising on tough economic times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Sanna Marin was &lt;a href="https://yle.fi/a/3-12036382"&gt;the most popular prime minister in Finland this century&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-finland-sweden-role-model/a-55664117"&gt;praised for her handling of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and led her country &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/finland-to-join-nato-on-tuesday-as-russia-sounds-border-warning"&gt;to join Nato - today&lt;/a&gt; - with overwhelming support. Sunday’s election saw her centre-left Social Democratic party (SDP) &lt;a href="https://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/EKV-2023/en/tulos_kokomaa.html"&gt;increase its vote share and number of MPs&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/sanna-marin-finland-election-sdp-social-democratic-national-coalition"&gt;she and the SDP have been defeated&lt;/a&gt; – and Finland is moving to the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the results came in, the leader of the conservative National Coalition party (NCP), Petteri Orpo, said his party was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/finland-shifts-to-the-right-coalition-talks-petteri-orpo-ncp-sanna-marin-election"&gt;“a clear alternative to the leftwing government&lt;/a&gt;”. He is likely to be the next prime minister. And while it is possible that he will ultimately form a coalition with the SDP, he may first seek to form a government with the far-right Finns party, which had its best election result ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| More than a dozen women &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/03/revealed-new-claims-of-sexual-misconduct-and-toxic-culture-at-cbi"&gt;have made allegations of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt; against senior figures at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the country’s most influential business lobbying organisation. The claims include an alleged rape at a staff boat party on the River Thames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Thomas Cashman &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/03/thomas-cashman-jailed-for-life-olivia-pratt-korbel-murder"&gt;has been sentenced for at least 42 years&lt;/a&gt; for the murder of Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool in August. Speaking before the verdict, Olivia’s mother Cheryl described her as a “beautiful, sassy, chatty girl who never ran out of energy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US politics &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/03/donald-trump-court-appearance-new-york-city"&gt;arrived in New York City a day before he is due in court&lt;/a&gt; to respond to the first ever criminal indictment filed against a former American president. Media organisations have petitioned for the release of the indictment, which reportedly contains upwards of 30 charges and at least one felony related to hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water pollution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | England’s most celebrated beaches &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/03/englands-top-beaches-faced-8500-hours-of-sewage-dumping-last-year-study-says"&gt;faced 8,500 hours of sewage dumping last year&lt;/a&gt;, new figures show. Many beaches with blue flag status – an international mark that a beach is deemed safe and has good water quality – were found to have been covered in waste over the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Nigel Lawson, who was chancellor for six years during Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/03/former-conservative-chancellor-nigel-lawson-dies-aged-91"&gt;has died at the age of 91&lt;/a&gt;. Rishi Sunak described him as “a transformational chancellor and an inspiration”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/04/first-edition-sanna-marin-finland-election"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Monday briefing: What the AI boom really means for your job (and mine)</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/monday-briefing-what-the-ai-boom-really-means-for-your-job-and-mine</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: As big business invests in artificial intelligence, the future of work might be changing before our eyes – but who loses out most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Quite a high proportion of journalistic output on the sudden explosion in generative AI is now prefaced with an announcement that the author has asked ChatGPT to write on their behalf. I am much too motivated by self-interest to follow that approach, which seems to me less like turkeys voting for Christmas than turkeys slathering themselves in butter, turning the oven up, and hopping on in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the fringes, there are already ominous signs of the outlook for content drones like me: witness, for example, the news that &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/buzzfeed-publishing-articles-by-ai"&gt;BuzzFeed has published a series of (quite bad) travel guides&lt;/a&gt; bylined “Buzzy the Robot”. Meanwhile, there have been reports of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ake53e/ai-art-lawsuits-midjourney-dalle-chatgpt"&gt;illustrators replaced by AI image generator Midjourney&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly half of business leaders &lt;a href="https://www.resumebuilder.com/1-in-4-companies-have-already-replaced-workers-with-chatgpt/"&gt;in a US survey&lt;/a&gt; said that they expected layoffs as a result of the use of ChatGPT before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Thousands of children experiencing “unacceptable” long waits for NHS treatment &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/03/thousands-of-children-in-england-facing-unacceptable-nhs-delays"&gt;face a “lifelong” impact on their health&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has warned, as shocking figures reveal that nearly 15,000 paediatric operations were cancelled over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finland &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/sanna-marin-finland-election-sdp-social-democratic-national-coalition"&gt;lost the battle to stay in power&lt;/a&gt; after her centre-left Social Democratic party was narrowly beaten into third place by conservative and far-right rivals in Sunday’s elections. The leader of the conservative NCP, Petteri Orpo, is expected to open coalition negotiations on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex trafficking &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Rishi Sunak &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/02/rishi-sunak-says-grooming-gang-crackdown-will-defy-political-correctness"&gt;is to announce new measures to tackle grooming gangs&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, claiming that “political correctness” would not get in the way of a crackdown. On Sunday, home secretary Suella Braverman was accused of “dog whistle” rhetoric after singling out British Pakistani men over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A prominent pro-war Russian military blogger &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/russian-pro-war-military-blogger-killed-blast-st-petersburg-vladlen-tatarsky"&gt;has been killed in a blast in a St Petersburg cafe&lt;/a&gt;. Some 30 people were injured in an explosion that killed Vladlen Tatarsky, real name Maxim Fomin. A St Petersburg woman previously detained for taking part in anti-war rallies was arrested, the Interfax news agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician whose remarkably eclectic career straddled pop, experimentalism, and Oscar-winning film composition, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-japanese-pop-pioneer-and-oscar-winning-composer-dies-aged-71"&gt;has died aged 71&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-the-avant-gardist-who-became-a-groundbreaking-pop-star"&gt;Read Alexis Petridis’ tribute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/monday-briefing-what-the-ai-boom-really-means-for-your-job-and-mine"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Russia’s presidency of UN security council a ‘symbolic blow’, says Ukraine</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/01/russia-presidency-un-security-council-symbolic-blow-says-ukraine</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The last time Moscow held the post was in February 2022, when its troops launched invasion of Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A top Ukrainian official has criticised the “symbolic blow” of Russia assuming the rotating presidency of the United Nations security council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, wrote on Twitter on Saturday: “It’s not just a shame. It is another symbolic blow to the rules-based system of international relations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/01/russia-presidency-un-security-council-symbolic-blow-says-ukraine"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Friday briefing: What to know about a vast new leak exposing Russia’s cyberwarfare network</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/31/first-edition-vulkan-files-putin-cyberwarfare</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: A six-month investigation from the Guardian and others gives unprecedented access into Putin’s intelligence agencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, Donald Trump was finally &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/30/donald-trump-indicted-stormy-daniels-hush-money"&gt;indicted by a grand jury in New York&lt;/a&gt; over hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in 2016. It is a historic development, as Trump, who claimed the indictment amounted to “political persecution”, becomes the first US president to be criminally indicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Thomas Cashman &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/30/thomas-cashman-found-guilty-of-murdering-olivia-pratt-korbel-liverpool"&gt;has been found guilty&lt;/a&gt; of murdering nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel at her home in Liverpool. The 34-year-old was convicted by a jury at Manchester crown court of shooting Olivia dead and injuring her mother, Cheryl Korbel, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate crisis |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The Conservative party received £3.5m from individuals and entities linked to climate denial, fossil fuels and high-pollution industries last year, &lt;a href="https://theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/tory-partys-35m-dirty-donations-revealed-by-desmog-analysis"&gt;according to analysis&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the climate website DeSmog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metropolitan police |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; A Met police firearms officer &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/30/met-officer-referred-to-prosecutors-over-fatal-shooting-of-chris-kaba"&gt;has been referred to prosecutors&lt;/a&gt; to consider a potential murder charge, after the shooting of Chris Kaba in September 2022 in south London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Four bankers who helped Sergei Roldugin, a close friend of Vladimir Putin, move millions of francs through bank accounts in Switzerland have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/four-bankers-who-helped-putin-wallet-sergei-roldugin-set-up-swiss-accounts-convicted"&gt;convicted of financial crimes&lt;/a&gt;. They were all found guilty of failing to adequately perform due diligence on financial transactions involving Roldugin’s accounts. Roldugin’s secret financial affairs came to light in 2016 as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers"&gt;Panama papers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Hollywood star and lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow has been found &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/30/gwyneth-paltrow-utah-ski-crash-trial-verdict"&gt;not at fault, after she was sued over a skiing collision&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. The jury found retired optometrist Terry Sanderson – who brought the case – at fault for the crash and awarded Paltrow damages of $1, as she requested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/31/first-edition-vulkan-files-putin-cyberwarfare"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Thursday briefing: Why the Home Office’s latest idea to cut the asylum seeker backlog will run aground too</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/first-edition-home-office-asylum-seekers-cruise-ships</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: Amelia Gentleman explains why governmental incompetence, not asylum seekers eager to stay in mythical luxury hotels, is at the root of the problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. You have probably been wondering, as an innately curious and sceptical consumer of the news, what sort of robust policy development work stands behind yesterday’s front-page grabbing government proposals &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/28/home-office-planning-to-house-asylum-seekers-on-disused-cruise-ships"&gt;to put asylum seekers on barges and cruise ships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of an account from home secretary Suella Braverman, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizziedearden/status/1640997431574769668"&gt;the Independent’s Lizzie Dearden&lt;/a&gt; has a timeline that may help answer the question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | The UK government will defy scientific doubts &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/government-gambles-on-carbon-capture-and-storage-tech-despite-scientists-doubts"&gt;to place a massive bet on carbon capture and storage in undersea caverns&lt;/a&gt;, to enable an expansion of oil and gas in the North Sea. The “powering up Britain” strategy, to be unveiled today, will also include boosts for offshore wind and hydrogen but no new government spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slavery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Experts from the UN have called for the British government and the royal family &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/mar/29/uk-government-royals-called-on-investigate-slavery-links-after-guardian-apology"&gt;to scrutinise their historical links to transatlantic slavery&lt;/a&gt; and move towards restorative justice. The appeal comes after an apology from the Scott Trust for the role of the Guardian’s founders in slavery. Read more from the Cotton Capital series below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| A refuse workers’ strike in Paris &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/paris-breathes-easier-as-refuse-workers-strike-called-off-and-rubbish-cleared"&gt;was called off yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, leading to much of the 10,000 metric tonnes of festering rubbish that had accumulated on the streets being cleared. But union leaders said they would discuss resuming industrial action if Emmanuel Macron’s government does not revoke a new law raising the official retirement age to 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Ministers should be more aggressive in tackling oppression, violence and radicalisation in religious settings, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/ministers-urged-to-be-more-aggressive-in-tackling-issues-within-religious-groups"&gt;a forthcoming review of the relationship between faith and the state will say&lt;/a&gt;. The recommendations are also likely to bolster calls for stricter oversight of Islamic groups, which have sparked anger among British Muslims in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Astronomers at Durham University &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/29/ultramassive-black-hole-astronomers-durham-university"&gt;have discovered an ultramassive black hole&lt;/a&gt; that is about 30bn times the mass of the sun, making it one of the biggest ever found. The scientists detected it using a new technique known as gravitational lensing. The team behind the findings described them as “extremely exciting”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/first-edition-home-office-asylum-seekers-cruise-ships"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Wednesday briefing: The real origins of the money that helped found the Guardian</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/first-edition-cotton-capital</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: The Guardian’s owner has apologised for the newspaper’s historic links to the trade of enslaved people – this is why&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. The story of the Manchester Guardian began in 1821, in the aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/04/peterloo-massacre-bloody-clash-that-changed-britain#:~:text=The%20storming%20of%20the%20Bastille,were%20well%20within%20living%20memory."&gt;the Peterloo massacre&lt;/a&gt;, when working people rallying for political reform were killed by the troops sent to disperse them. It was founded with the financial backing of a group of middle-class radicals who shared founding editor John Edward Taylor’s commitment to enlightenment values, liberty, and justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a true story. But it is also an incomplete one. Yesterday, the Scott Trust – which owns the Guardian today – &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/ng-interactive/2023/mar/28/the-scott-trust-legacies-of-enslavement-report"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; which excavates a far darker aspect of the newspaper’s history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate crisis &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The UK &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/29/uk-strikingly-unprepared-impacts-climate-crisis"&gt;is “strikingly unprepared” for the impacts of the climate crisis&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Climate Change Committee (CCC), which said there had been a “lost decade” in efforts to adapt for the impacts of global heating. The body said “fully credible” UK government planning was found for only five of the 45 adaptation requirements examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul O’Grady &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Paul O’Grady, the beloved TV presenter and comedian who broke on to the scene with his drag act persona Lily Savage, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/29/paul-ogrady-presenter-and-comedian-dies-aged-67"&gt;has died at the age of 67&lt;/a&gt;. His partner Andre Portasio said O’Grady passed away “peacefully but unexpectedly” on Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | The Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/china-warns-of-retaliation-if-taiwans-president-meets-us-house-speaker"&gt;has threatened retaliation&lt;/a&gt; if Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, meets the US House speaker this week, and urged the US not to let her transit through the country, saying it would be a “provocation”. Tsai is due to visit Central American allies and is also expected to visit the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotland &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Humza Yousaf has said &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/28/humza-yousaf-snp-unity-bid-stumbles-kate-forbes-declines-cabinet-offer-scotland"&gt;becoming Scotland’s first Muslim leader&lt;/a&gt; sends a strong message “to every single person out there who feels that they don’t belong”. But the first minister’s attempts to reunite the SNP after a bitter leadership campaign were dealt a blow after his main rival, Kate Forbes, turned down a position in his cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Prince Harry &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/28/prince-harry-royals-agreed-not-to-sue-newspapers-over-phone-hacking"&gt;has claimed members of the royal family struck a secret deal with newspapers&lt;/a&gt; not to sue them over phone hacking because it would “open a can of worms”. In high court documents, he said there was a private deal with Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers, which publishes the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the American civil war the inflow of American cotton into Britain was vast, and around two and a half thousand cotton mills and factories had emerged in Lancashire, many of them in and around Manchester – a city known by the middle decades of the century as Cottonopolis. As was fully understood at the time, much of the cotton that was spun, woven, dyed, processed and traded in Manchester was produced by the almost 2 million enslaved Africans who lived, worked and suffered on cotton plantations in the southern United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/first-edition-cotton-capital"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tuesday briefing: What Humza Yousaf’s win means for Scotland, the SNP and independence</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/first-edition-humza-yousaf-snp-leader</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: The former health minister inherits a party, country and movement in flux from predecessor Nicola Sturgeon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. After a brutal and destabilising SNP leadership contest, Humza Yousaf is the party’s new leader. Today he should be confirmed as the first Scottish first minister from an ethnic minority, and the first Muslim to lead a major British political party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what turned out to be a very tight race, Yousaf beat his rival Kate Forbes by 52% to 48% after the votes of third-placed Ash Regan were redistributed. And while he promised that “we will be the team, we will be the generation that delivers independence for Scotland”, the work ahead of him is considerable: independence looks further away than it did when Nicola Sturgeon announced her resignation, and the fractures within the party have been brought into sharp relief. For the first time in a long time, the SNP’s ability to maintain its status as the dominant force in Scottish politics looks in serious doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Benjamin Netanyahu &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/israel-netanyahu-judiciary-plans-halt"&gt;has announced a delay to his far-right government’s proposals&lt;/a&gt; to overhaul the judiciary after 12 weeks of escalating political crisis. After a day of protests prompted in part by the resignation of his defence minister, the embattled prime minister said the changes would be delayed to the next parliamentary session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Doreen Lawrence has claimed the Daily Mail &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/27/doreen-lawrence-claims-daily-mail-hired-investigators-to-hack-her-phone"&gt;hired private investigators to hack her phone&lt;/a&gt; for information on her murdered son Stephen, potentially disrupting the police investigation into his death. Lawrence, the Duke of Sussex and Elton John are among those bringing high court cases against Associated Newspapers alleging illegal reporting tactics. See &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/27/the-allegations-against-daily-mails-parent-company-associated-newspapers"&gt;more details of the allegations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US gun violence | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A former student &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/27/tennessee-nashville-school-shooting-covenant"&gt;killed three children and three adults&lt;/a&gt; at a Christian elementary school in Nashville on Monday, armed with two “assault-style” weapons and a handgun. Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/27/biden-tennessee-school-shooting-gun-control-congress"&gt;called the shootings&lt;/a&gt; “heartbreaking, a family’s worst nightmare” and again called on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | A survey by Equity, the performing arts union, has found that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/27/most-chorus-members-would-quit-if-eno-leaves-london-survey-suggests"&gt;most chorus members would have to quit the English National Opera&lt;/a&gt; if the company were to relocate outside London because of personal obligations tying them to the capital. More than two-thirds of those people said they would be forced to leave the profession altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | One of Europe’s largest ammunition manufacturers has said efforts to meet demand from the war in Ukraine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/28/energy-hungry-tiktok-data-centre-ukraine-ammunition-production-nammo-norway"&gt;have been stymied by a new TikTok data centre&lt;/a&gt; monopolising electricity near its biggest factory. “We are concerned because we see our future growth is challenged by the storage of cat videos,” chief executive Morten Brandtzæg said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/first-edition-humza-yousaf-snp-leader"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Monday briefing: The four criminal cases that could leave Donald Trump in real trouble</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/monday-briefing-the-four-criminal-cases-that-could-leave-donald-trump-in-real-trouble</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: A guide to the key cases catching up with the former president&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. I realise you will probably cock an eyebrow when you read this, so please know that it’s said advisedly: Donald Trump is in fairly serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape"&gt;locker room talk&lt;/a&gt;, post-&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-william-barr-trump-russia-investigation"&gt;Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, post-&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/30/trump-tax-returns-released-us-house-committee"&gt;tax returns&lt;/a&gt;, post-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Donald_Trump_controversies"&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt; you may take such claims with a pinch of salt – but today the array of problems facing Trump look different. He is drifting far from the high-water mark of his popularity, many of his former supporters show signs of wanting to move on, and the legal consequences that may befall him are hard to shake off by sheer force of incoherent social media post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to protest after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/benjamin-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-yoav-gallant-judicial-overhaul"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defence minister&lt;/a&gt; over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul. Yoav Gallant was the first senior member of the ruling Likud party to speak out against the plan, which critics say remove crucial guards against authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNP &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The Scottish National party is preparing to announce later on Monday &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/27/new-snp-leader-may-need-deals-with-unionist-parties-warn-scottish-greens"&gt;which candidate has won the bitterly contested battle&lt;/a&gt; to be Scotland’s next first minister, with Nicola Sturgeon’s preferred candidate, Humza Yousaf, widely considered the favourite. Read &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/26/from-the-nhs-to-independence-whats-in-the-next-snp-leaders-in-tray"&gt;what’s in the winner’s in-tray&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The NHS in England needs a massive injection of homegrown doctors, nurses, GPs and dentists to avert a recruitment crisis that could leave it short of 571,000 staff, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/26/nhs-england-staff-shortages-could-exceed-570000-by-2036-study-finds"&gt;according to an internal document seen by the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. The workforce plan says that the health service is already 154,000 staff short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Ukraine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-accused-of-taking-belarus-nuclear-hostage-missile-deal-ukraine"&gt;has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus&lt;/a&gt; and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin announced a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons there. It is the first time Putin has announced a plan to station nuclear weapons in another country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrous oxide &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Michael Gove has defended the government’s plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/26/laughing-gas-ban-nitrous-oxide-michael-gove"&gt;ban the sale of laughing gas&lt;/a&gt; despite counsel from the UK’s drug advisory panel not to do so. Gove said that the use of nitrous oxide canisters was “despoiling public spaces” and “contributes to antisocial behaviour overall”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/monday-briefing-the-four-criminal-cases-that-could-leave-donald-trump-in-real-trouble"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Friday briefing: How French pensions protests reached new heights last night</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/french-pensions-protests-new-heights</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s newsletter: Demonstrations over Emmanuel Macron’s plan to reform the French pensions system intensified last night, with Bordeaux city hall set on fire. Here’s what you need to know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email"&gt;Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Since Emmanuel Macron &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/16/emmanuel-macron-uses-special-powers-to-force-pension-reform-france"&gt;forced through his plans&lt;/a&gt; to raise the pension age in France last week, public dismay over the change to a fiercely protected feature of French social policy has been bubbling. Last night, at the end of the ninth day of nationwide protests since January, that anger reached boiling point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most visible symbol of the tensions came in video from Bordeaux, where &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/workers-block-paris-airport-terminal-pension-protests-continue-france"&gt;the doors of the city hall were set alight&lt;/a&gt; after a day of intensifying action on the streets. The blaze was quickly put out by firefighters. But all over the country, the unpopularity of Macron’s plans was plainly visible. The authorities put the number of people on the streets at 1.1m, while unions said it was about 3.5m. Either way, the severity of the clashes between protesters and the police – and scale of the wider movement – suggest that the fight against the reforms is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Taxpayers have spent close to half a billion pounds buying beds in the worst care homes in England in the last four years, driving profits for private investors while residents suffer unsafe treatment, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/23/english-councils-spent-480m-on-inadequate-care-homes-in-four-years"&gt;a Guardian investigation has revealed&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022 one pound in every five spent buying residential elderly care went on homes in the poorest categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronavirus support &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Just 1% of the estimated £1.1bn lost from the government’s Covid business support programme in England as a result of fraud and error &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/24/covid-business-support-grants-scheme-recovered-fraud-error-report"&gt;has been recovered so far&lt;/a&gt;, the public spending watchdog has said in a report urging ministers to learn lessons from the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | The chief executive of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, was forced to defend his company’s relationship with China, as well as the protections for its youngest users, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/tiktok-shou-zi-chew-congress"&gt;at a testy hearing in Washington on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The hearing came amid a bipartisan push to ban the app entirely in the US over national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A council leader who has been embroiled in a row after ordering the felling of more than 100 trees &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/23/plymouth-council-leader-quits-after-approving-110-trees-being-cut-down"&gt;is to resign&lt;/a&gt;. Richard Bingley, the leader of Plymouth city council, signed an executive decision to remove the trees to make way for a £12m regeneration scheme, a move which angered opponents who called it “environmental vandalism”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The BBC has said &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/23/bbc-will-not-resume-filming-top-gear-series-after-flintoff-crash-investigation"&gt;it will not resume filming the latest series of Top Gear&lt;/a&gt; after co-presenter former England cricket captain Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff was injured in a crash last year. The broadcaster said there will be a health and safety review on the motoring show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/french-pensions-protests-new-heights"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
